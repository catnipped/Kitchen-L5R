 	<h1>Legend of the Five Rings — 'Kitchen' Proxies</h1>
 	
<!--
 	<h2>About</h2><br/>
 	I made this proxy generator for people who want to try out cards from SW Destiny before buying them. Keep in mind that unlike FFG's native dice app, this web-app is not tournament legal. It's intended for casual kitchen table play only.<br/>This open-source project was made by <a href="https://twitter.com/ossianboren" target="_blank">@ossianboren</a> (<a href="https://github.com/catnipped/SWDestinyProxy" target="_blank" >github link</a>) using an API from <a href="http://swdestinydb.com">swdestinydb.com</a>. The project hosts no copyrighted content.<br/><i>ps! also check out my other project: <a href="http://ossianboren.com/DestinyDice/">SW Destiny 'Kitchen' Dice</a></i><br/>
 		<br/>
 		<h2>Instructions</h2><br/>
 		Add cards by their ID number. Then print from your browser (they should be neatly gridded for cutting).<br/>
 		<br/>
 		<h2>Custom Database</h2><br/>
 		If you <a href="SWDestinyProxy.zip">download this page</a>, you can provide your own database! Just get the cards.json from <a href="http://swdestinydb.com/api/public/cards/">here</a>, put it in the SWDestinyProxy folder, then change cards.json however you like! (Translations, custom cards, etc)<br/>
