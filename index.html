 	<h1>Legend of the Five Rings — 'Kitchen' Proxies</h1>
 	

 	<h2>About</h2><br/>
 	I made this proxy generator for people who want to try out cards from Legend of the Five Rings before buying them. Keep in mind that any cards you print aren't tournament legal. It's intended for casual kitchen table play only.<br/>This open-source project was made by <a href="https://twitter.com/ossianboren" target="_blank">@ossianboren</a> (<a href="https://github.com/catnipped/Kitchen-L5R" target="_blank" >github link</a>) using an API from <a href="http://fiveringsdb.com">fiveringsdb.com</a>. The project hosts no copyrighted content.<br/><i>ps! also check out <a href="http://ossianboren.com/catnipped">my other projects.</a></i><br/>
    <br/>
    <h2>Instructions</h2><br/>
    Add cards by replacing the list below with names or id's of cards you want in quotes and commas for each new entry "Like","This" . A card's id is its name in lower case with dashes instead of special characters "like-this".
    <br/>
    Once you're happy just press print and the cards should show neatly at 9 cards per page, make sure to print backgrounds. Check 'low-ink" for grayscale high contrast versions.
