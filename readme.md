I made this proxy generator for people who want to try out cards from _Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game_ before buying them.

#INSTRUCTIONS:
Just [download](https://github.com/catnipped/Kitchen-L5R/archive/master.zip) and unzip, or [visit the web version](https://catnipped.github.io/Kitchen-L5R/) then add cards by their ID. Then print from your browser (they should be neatly gridded for cutting).

#CUSTOM DATABASE
If you downloaded the zip, you can provide your own database! Just get the cards.json from [here](https://api.fiveringsdb.com/cards), put it in the kitchen-l5r folder, then change cards.json however you like! (Translations, custom cards, etc)

Trust in the Imperial Favor!
