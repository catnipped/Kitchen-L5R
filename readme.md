I made this proxy generator for people who want to try out cards from _Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game_ before buying them.

#INSTRUCTIONS:
Just [visit the web version](https://catnipped.github.io/Kitchen-L5R/) then add cards by their ID or name and print from your browser (they should be neatly gridded for cutting).

Have Fun!
